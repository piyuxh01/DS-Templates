## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of common data structures that are widely used in computer science and programming. The goal is to provide well-structured and efficient implementations that can be easily understood and integrated into various projects.

## List of Data Structures

The repository includes the following data structures:

- [Array](array.md)
- [Linked List](linked-list.md)
- [Stack](stack.md)
- [Queue](queue.md)
- [Hash Table](hash-table.md)
- [Binary Tree](binary-tree.md)
- [Segment Tree](segment-tree.md)
- [Heap](heap.md)
- [Graph](graph.md)

Each data structure is documented in a separate file, providing a detailed explanation of its properties, operations, and usage examples. You can click on the links above to access the documentation for each data structure.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures in your project, simply import the corresponding module or file into your codebase. You can follow the usage examples provided in the documentation for each data structure. Feel free to explore the other data structures and their respective usage examples in the documentation files.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional data structures to add, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and include appropriate tests for any new implementations.
